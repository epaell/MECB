# SW
Basic software for the MECB 8088

#monitor
A simple monitor that can be programmed into the ROM (occupies FC00:0000 onwards). Provides functionality to examine and modify memory, I/O and registers. Also provides a means to load software via Intel HEX format through terminal. Can also execute loaded software. The original software from which this was based did also provide tracing, stepping and disassembly but I haven't tested these nor have they been fully included.

#test_load
A simple "Hello, World" program that can run on the MECB_8088. The hex file generated by the build can be loaded via the "L" command and can be run with "G 0100".
