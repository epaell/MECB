# ASSIST09
The combined version of ASSIST09 is based on the [Jeff Tranter's SBC version](https://github.com/jefftranter/6809/tree/master/sbc/combined) of the software but adapted for [DigiCoolThings MECB 6809](https://github.com/DigicoolThings/MECB). It contains Extended Microsoft BASIC, a disassembler, tracing software and ASSIST09 itself.

The modified code assumes the following MECB set-up:

MECB Memory map

    $0000-$BFFF RAM
    
       $0000-$0217 BASIC use
       
       $BED0-$BEDC Disasm use
       
       $BEE0-$BEFF Trace use
       
       $BF00-$BFFF ASSIST09
       
    $C000-$C100 I/O
    
        $C000 PTM
        
        $C008 ACIA
        
    $C100-FFFF  ROM
    
        $C100-$E4D7 Extended basic
        
        $E500-$F0CF Disassembler
        
        $F100-$F7E4 Trace
        
        $F800-$FFFE ASSIST09

The code has been adapted to work with asm6809:

To compile the combined version simply run "build".

Currently the binary output generated by the assembler is a bit awkward to use with FLASH programmers so a simple Python script is provided to make a simpler binary that exactly matches the specification of the AT28C256 FLASH ROM used with the MECB (32 KB). A programmable binary is also provided (AT28C256_combo.bin).
